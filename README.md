## Links

- Live site: https://jasmi1901.github.io/jasmi1901/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/jasmi1901/jasmi1901

## Steps:

- I have developed a web page using HTML and CSS. 
- The structure includes essential semantic elements like head, body, div, section, Unordered list, and images.
- The page contains two headings and four distinct sections, each identified with unique id attributes.
- I incorporated images and a footer, applied background colors and a background image using CSS, and styled the text 
   with custom font  sizes and text alignment. 
- Additionally, I implemented animations on the header, images, and contact section to enhance interactivity.
- The project is version-controlled with Github.
- I created a repository named jasmi1901 on GitHub and organized the workflow using two branches: main and dev.

## What i learned :
- I learned how to structure a web page using HTML elements and using CSS for styling-changing colors, fonts
   and making the page look visually appealing.
- I learned how to organize my files properly and link them correctly.
- I became more comfortable using browser developer tools (inspect element) to debug and test my design live.
- And also learned git hub and the basics of version control to keep changes and collaborate.

## What i struggled :
- I struggled with aligning elements properly using CSS.
- I faced issues like broken links, missing image and styling not applying due to small syntax errors.
- Balancing between content writing and coding took more time than i expected.
