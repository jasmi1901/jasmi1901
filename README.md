# My web page

My live site: https://jasmi1901.github.io/jasmi1901/

My Git hub repo: https://github.com/jasmi1901/jasmi1901

Steps:

I have developed a web page using HTML and CSS. 
The structure includes essential semantic elements like head, body, div, section, Unordered list, and images.
The page contains two headings and four distinct sections, each identified with unique id attributes.
I incorporated images and a footer, applied background colors and a background image using CSS, and styled the text with custom font sizes and text alignment. 
Additionally, I implemented animations on the header, images, and contact section to enhance interactivity.

The project is version-controlled with Github.

I created a repository named jasmi1901 on GitHub and organized the workflow using two branches: main and dev.
